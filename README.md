# poi_homework

homework for machine learning course

This project is a project submitted to Udacity as requirement to pass the "intorudction to machine learning" course. Notice that the version of python here is 2.7



There are three files important here:

## poi_id.py

This contains the code. It is ready to run and gives result of the chosen classifier
This file contains some additional methods that are not run unless you edit the code to call them.
They are left there to show that I tried multiple classifiers. 



## questionsAnswers.pdf

It contains the answer for the accompanying questions to this project.

## ref.txt

Including the references that I came over during this project.
